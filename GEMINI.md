# Task Titans Project

## Project Overview

Task Titans is a family chore management application designed to gamify household tasks. Its core vision is to transform chores into engaging quests for children, allowing them to earn XP and virtual Gold, which can then be redeemed for custom, real-world rewards defined by their parents. This aims to foster a fun, rewarding, and collaborative family experience, replacing traditional household friction with engagement.

The application targets families with children and includes two primary dashboards:
*   **Admin Dashboard (Parents):** For creating and managing quests, assigning XP/Gold, setting due dates, and approving task completion.
*   **Hero Dashboard (Children):** For browsing and claiming quests, marking tasks as done, and tracking their progress (level, gold).

Additional core features include a Custom Redemption Shop where Gold can be exchanged for parent-defined rewards, and a Family Leaderboard to track rankings based on total XP.

### Technology Stack

*   **Frontend:** Flutter
*   **Backend:** Express.js (RESTful APIs)
*   **Database:** Decision pending (MySQL, Supabase, or Firebase are under consideration).

## Building and Running

This section will contain instructions for setting up, building, and running the Task Titans project for both the Flutter frontend and the Express.js backend.

**TODO:** Add detailed commands for:
*   Setting up the development environment.
*   Installing dependencies for both frontend and backend.
*   Building the Flutter application.
*   Starting the Express.js backend server.
*   Running tests for both components.

## Development Conventions

As the project is in its early planning stages, specific development conventions such as coding styles, testing practices, or contribution guidelines have not yet been formalized. These will be established as the development progresses to ensure consistency and maintainability across the codebase.
