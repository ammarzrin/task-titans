Design a mobile app UI for "Task Titans," a family chore gamification app with a bold "Comic Book / Superhero Pop" aesthetic. The target audience is families with children aged 5-12.

**Design Style & Vibe:**

- **Theme:** Energetic, fun, bold, and empowering. Think classic superhero comics meets modern mobile UI.
- **Color Palette ("Power Pop"):**
  - Primary Colors: Electric Blue (#0056FF), Vigilante Red (#FF1D25), Lightning Yellow (#FFD700).
  - Accents: Thick Black Outlines (#000000) for borders and buttons to give a "drawn" or "sticker" look.
  - Backgrounds: Clean White (#FFFFFF) with subtle halftone dot patterns or diagonal speed lines.
- **Typography:**
  - Headings: "Bungee" (A Google Font - bold, geometric, stacked look).
  - Body: "Nunito" (Rounded, friendly, readable sans-serif).
- **Visual Elements:** Speech bubbles for text, starburst "POW!" shapes for rewards, bold drop shadows on buttons, sticker-style SVG icons.

**Key Screens to Generate:**

1.  **Login / User Selection:**

    - A grid of user avatars (Circular, comic-style hero faces).
    - When an avatar is tapped, show a "Secret Identity PIN" entry screen (4-digit input).
    - Background should be dynamic (halftone pattern).

2.  **Parent Dashboard ("Mission Control"):**

    - **Header:** "Mission Control" title.
    - **Main Section:** A list of active "Missions" (chores). Each item should look like a bold comic panel or card containing: Mission Icon, Title, and status.
    - **Action:** A large, floating "Create Mission" button (+ icon) with a thick border.
    - **Notification Area:** A "Pending Approvals" section showing a notification badge or list of completed tasks waiting for review.

3.  **Child Dashboard ("Hero HQ"):**

    - **Top "Hero Card":** A prominent stats area showing the Child's Avatar, current "Hero Rank" (Level), a bold "Energy Bar" (XP progress), and a "Gold Stash" counter.
    - **Mission Board:** A 2-column grid of available missions.
    - **Mission Card:** Each card acts as a "Wanted Poster" or "Mission File" with a big central icon, Star rating (difficulty), and Gold reward amount.
    - **Navigation:** Bottom tab bar with bold icons: "HQ" (Home), "My Missions" (Active), "Loot Store" (Shop).

4.  **Loot Store (Redemption):**

    - A grid of reward items (e.g., "Ice Cream", "Screen Time").
    - Each item shows a cost in Gold.
    - A "Buy" button that looks like a comic book action button.

5.  **Mission Creation Modal:**
    - A pop-up form with a "Mission Title" input.
    - **Difficulty Selector:** 4 big, colorful buttons labeled "Easy", "Medium", "Hard", "Epic" (these auto-set the XP/Gold).
    - **Icon Grid:** A selection of hero-themed icons (broom, bed, trash can, etc.).

**Interactions:**

- Buttons should look tappable (3D effect/drop shadow).
- Focus on clear, large touch targets suitable for children.
